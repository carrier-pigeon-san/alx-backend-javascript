# 0x01. ES6 Promises

## Description
This project covers the basics of ES6 Promises, a powerful feature in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. You will learn how to create, use, and manage promises to write cleaner and more efficient asynchronous code.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of promises and their states.
- Create and use promises.
- Handle promise resolution and rejection.
- Chain promises for sequential asynchronous operations.
- Use `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`.

## Project Structure
- `0-promise.js`: Basic promise creation and usage.
- `1-promise.js`: Handling promise resolution and rejection.
- `2-promise.js`: Chaining promises.
- `3-promise.js`: Using `Promise.all`.
- `4-promise.js`: Using `Promise.race`.
